Facet API Context
=================

This module integrates Facet API with Context module. Initial idea has been
discussed in http://drupal.org/node/1379308 issue.

Features:

Facet Values conditions
-----------------------

We can have condition that will be triggered based on current page active facets.
For example we can place special block in case specific facets are selected on
the search page. This is very useful in terms of adding some help information.
Like for the shop if user selected special manufacturer we can place block
with some information about this brand.
